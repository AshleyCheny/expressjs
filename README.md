This is a repository copy from the author for practice purpose. The course link: [lynda.com](http://lynda.com).

# Notes
## How NodeJS works?
- Load modules with `require();`
- Built-in or external

## Modules
- http

## How Express Works?
- Provide additional methods
- `require()`
- `express()`
- No mime type
  - A MIME type is a label used to identify a type of data. Eg. text/html
  - Express will handle mime type
- Easy routing

## Express.js Basics
### Basic routing
- Use `app.get()`;
- Pass variables req.params
